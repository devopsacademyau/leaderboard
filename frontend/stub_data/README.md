# Sample Data

This directory contains stubbed backend data expected to be served at

    /api/chart/go-course-ca39e2f201323a18

The chart ID used in the JSON file's name was generated as
`repo-name`-`fnv-hash-of-chart-config`. The intention is to use the frontend
with any repo and chart data configuration.

ID and hash generation details can be found in the backend `chartID` function.
